# React Native ChatApp

## Description
The aim is building a chat mobile app using react native. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their
location.


### User Stories
* As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
* As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
* As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
* As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
* As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
* As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

### Key Features 
* A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat.
* A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
* The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.
* Data gets stored online and offline
